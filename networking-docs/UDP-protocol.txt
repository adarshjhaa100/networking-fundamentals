- Layer 4 protocol (Ports)
- Stateless (No state is stored in the machines)
- Communications bw two processes on different machines

Use Cases:
* Suitable where some of the data packet maybe lost at the cost of low latency

- Video Streaming
- VPN
- DNS
- Web RTC ( This is built in application layer for peer-to-peer communications)

Note: Layer 4 protocols should not be exposed directly 


Multiplexing/Demultiplexing:

    Multiplex (Sender's End): Connection from multiple ports goes through the same channel in a UDP packet
    Demux (Receiver's End): Connection from single channel is distributed among different ports.

Simplified UDP Header:

        Sender Port | Receiver Port

UDP Datagram:
    - Sender's and Receiver's Port (2 bytes each)
    - Goes in as data in User's IP packet
    - Data
    - Length of Data

Note: 
    Every i'th later of OSI sends its datagram/config as data to i-1'th layer.
