IP Address:
- Layer 3 protocol (network layer)
- 4bytes in IPv4


Network vs Host(Node in a network):

IPv4 of the form a.b.c.d/x (x is the number of bits represents the network)
possible number of hosts = 32-x (2 of which are reserved)

e.g. : 192.168.0.1/24 - network address = 192.168.0, possible no of hosts: 2^(32-24) = 256

Subnet Mask: 
    Represents the bits that form the network(subnet): 
    e.g. 255.255.255.0 = first 24 bits
         255.255.254.0 = first 23 bits   

    To check if 2 IP addresses are part of the same network,
    IP1 & Subnet = IP2 & Subnet


Gateway:

- Gateway is used to connect outside of a network, one of the IPs out of the subnet is reserved for gateway.
- In most situations, router is the gateway
- Router has one gateway for each network its connected in.


IP Packet:
    SourceIP + Data + DestIP
    The source and dest IP packet may change at each hop(across diff routers)

    e.g. : A->R1->R2->b

    let IP packet like: a|data|b
    A->R1: A|data|R1
    R1->R2: R1|data|R2
    R2->B: R2|data|B

    Need a routing table in this case to identify the actual path in case we want to send back data.
    

ICMP: 
- Internet control message protocol (Layer 3)
- Designed for info messages like:
    port unreachable, host unreachable, packet expired etc.
- Contains TTL: Time to live (No of hops available) which decrements at each router(or node in some case)
- We can use TTL for traceroute( route from source to dest)

ARP: 
- Address resolution protocol
- Layer 2
- Maps IP address with MAC
- ARP transmission is always local(within the same subnet)

e.g.: A, B and C are devices in a network, A wants to connect with b
A broadcasts the message to all devices including router(with dest IP of B),
B responds and A saves the mac of B alongwith IP.


Note: 
    If we are connecting to outside network, the source IP of Packet changes to External IP of last router encountered.
