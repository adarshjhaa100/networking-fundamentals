Before:

Single machine contained and ran the software system (Monolith machine).

Issues:
- Required Beefy machines.
- Users need to be physically present near the machines.     


Client-Server Model: Divide the computer system into client and server, where:

    Client:
    - Is lightweight and performs small tasks.
    - Possible to have the clients at multiple locations(cheaply).
    - client calls the server with a set of standard procedure to execute         business logic.

    Server:
    - Runs complex, hw intensive code. Requires hardware with high specs.
    - Can be centralized/ distributed.
    - RPC standards for calling the business logic.

    Communication:
        Need a communication model bw client and the server for RPCs.
