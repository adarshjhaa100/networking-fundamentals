Each node in a network contains a unique MAC address (this functionality is implemented using a network card).

Direct communication bw two nodes network:


If no system in place, Node-Node communication should take place as follows:
- This approach requires layer 2 (Data Link. MAC) implementation .
- Sender transmits message to all nodes. 
- nodes whose MAC address matches the receiver's will further process.

Issues with the above approach:
- Issue with data security, connection exposed to all devices.
- With millions of devices across the world, transmitting signals will cause a lot of delay.


Use of network layer protocol(layer 3 protocol):
- Use IP address to route connection between two nodes.
- IP address = network address + host address
- Router acts as a bridge between two different network.


What if communication is between two process:
- Need to use layer 4 protocol.
- Each process at different port.
